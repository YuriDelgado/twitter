# README

For the installation of this tweeter-like app is needed to fill the requirements listed below, also make sure you have installed the git command, there I included a list of commands to build the app locally.

This web app has the basic operations shown in tweeter such as post tweets, retweets, and liking tweets. It has basic authentication, based on email and password; the username is required for view purposes, this process is not that difficult to accomplish, the only requirement is not to register more than once an email.

Then clone the repo and move to the directory created.
